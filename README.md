# Exercise Tracker
MERN full stack application that allows users to create and maintain exercises.


## How to use
This full stack application requires NodeJS.
Since the backend uses MongoDB, you will need to create a new cluster and 
add an environment variable 'ATLAS_URI' set to your token in a .env file in the backend folder. 
After installing NodeJS and creating the .env file, follow these steps: 

	1. Navigate your terminal to the main folder
	2. Run "npm install"
	3. Navigate to the backend folder
	4. Run "nodemon server" to start up the web server
	5. Navigate to the main folder on a new terminal
	6. Run "npm start"
